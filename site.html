			<h1>WHAT</h1>
			<p>
			Wildfires and other fire based disasters are one of the many natural-and artificial-disasters that California has to deal with on a regular basis. One such example of this is the recent Los Angeles fires that laid waste to 24,000 acres. The purpose of this site is to explain the natural processes that enables the spread of these fires.

		<div id="why">
			<h1>WHY</h1>
			<h2>Root Causes</h2>
			<p>
			There are many factors behind both wild and man-made fires. One natural factor is lightning strikes that set fire to dead-or-dying trees. This fire eventually spreads, leading to a full-fledged wildfire. However, recent fires have had entirely man-made origins. A campfire not put out entirely or a an unfinished cigarette, these can cause dead twigs and leaves to catch fire and eventually also leads to a full blaze.
			<p>
			<h2>Exacerbating Conditions</h2>
			<p>
			While the above mentioned phenomena help start a fire, the phenomena that will be mentioned here actively increase the danger of the fire, through both direct and indirect means.
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Global Warming</h3></li>
				<p>
				As the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) has risen in the atmosphere, biologists, meteorologists, and botanists have seen a concerning amount of change to the ambient temperature and the water supply. These two factors are crucial in the spread of a wildfire.

				<ul>
					<li><h4>Water Shortages</h4></li>
					<p></p>
					<li><h4>Increasing Temperatures</h4></li>

			<h1>OTHER FIRES</h1>
			<p>
			There are so many fires to talk about, especially in California. From 2014-2024, there has been an average of almost 7,500 fires each year with close to a million acres being lost each time in damages. That said, here is a list of 5 fires that were particularly devastating to California, be it by lives taken or by acres lost.
			<ul>
				<li>Camp Fire - Nov. 2018 - Butte County, CA - 85 deaths. - DEADLIEST FIRE (ALSO MOST DESTRUCTIVE)</li>
				<li>August Complex Fire - Aug. 2020 - Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity Counties, CA - 1,032,648 acres of land lost. - LARGEST FIRE</li>
				<li>Tubbs Fire - Oct. 2017 - Napa & Sonoma Counties, CA - 5,646 structures destroyed - 4th MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE</li>
			</ul>

			As I hope you have seen throughout this site, fires are a major concern in California. They endanger critical ecosystems, halt important services, and most importantly, take lives. To combat these effects, we must give back. These are a few donation links. Thank you for your time.
