			<h1>WHAT</h1>
			<p>
			Wildfires and other fire based disasters are one of the many natural-and artificial-disasters that California has to deal with on a regular basis. One such example of this is the recent Los Angeles fires that laid waste to 24,000 acres. The purpose of this site is to explain the natural processes that enables the spread of these fires.

			<h1>WHY</h1>
			<h2>Root Causes</h2>
			<p>
			There are many factors behind both wild and man-made fires. One natural factor is lightning strikes that set fire to dead-or-dying trees. This fire eventually spreads, leading to a full-fledged wildfire. However, recent fires have had entirely man-made origins. A campfire not put out entirely or a an unfinished cigarette, these can cause dead twigs and leaves to catch fire and eventually also leads to a full blaze.
